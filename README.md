# Nanollet

Nanollet is decentralized, easy to use, and secure! The wallet needs less than 20MB of disk space and doesn't need a centralized server.

----------

### Wiki

In the wiki you can find some resources about Nanollet, or any app that is supported.  Take a look under the Wiki tab.

----------

###  Available features:

*Yes, you can send and receive payments, just like any wallet around the globe. However, Nanollet has some additional features.*

#### Apps:

- **Nanofy:** 
That allows you to sign a file, or arbitrary data, using Nano. This is so easy, simple and fast to be verified, also it’s basically free.

- **Nanollet 2FA**:
You can send transactionn requiring 2FA on a mobile phone. If someone steals one of your keys they don’t have the ability to move your money. It’s not secure as the multi-sig, but better than a simple password.

- **OpenCAP**
You can send money using a OpenCAP alias, for instance send money using nanollet$ogdolo.com. You can create an alias using any provider (like [ogdolo.com](https://ogdolo.com)) and the Nanollet will discover the address and send the funds.

- **NanoAlias**:
You can create your own alias inside the wallet, stored on the blockchain and without any centralized server. With this alias is possible to receive money by using a simple @nanollet, rather than use xrb_3tz9pdfskx934ce36cf6h17uspp4hzsamr5hk7u1wd6em1gfsnb618hfsafc.

#### Internal:

- **SeedFY:** 
That is the secure seed. The SeedFY can be consider as one part of your seed, that combines with your password to generate the seed. Because of that, holding only the SeedFY don’t guarantees immediately access to your funds.
